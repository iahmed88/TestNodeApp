1. Right know we are assuming one user can only invest in one product in specific group
   is that correct? 

2. What should be the tenor for interest calculation in group (Product tenor Or Group tenor)

3. Should interest be calculated in group per user per product(based on product) just like without group.

4. if point 3 is correct then how should the interest be divided over all Group Members (should that be equally ?)
